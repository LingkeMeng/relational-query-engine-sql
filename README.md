# Relational Backend System (Personal Project)

This repository contains a personal backend systems project focused on
relational database design, SQL query reasoning, and transactional correctness.

The project was originally inspired by coursework, but has since been
refactored and generalized into an independent learning and engineering project.

---

## Project Focus

This project explores how relational databases support:

- Structured data modeling
- Multi-table query execution
- Transaction consistency
- Time-series data analysis
- Backend service design

The emphasis is on **system architecture and database reasoning**, not on
providing a deployable or reproducible application.

---

## Key Concepts Explored

- Relational schema normalization (3NF / BCNF)
- Primary and foreign key constraints
- Join processing and aggregation
- Transaction scheduling and correctness
- SQL-based statistical computation
- Separation of logic and persistence layers

---

## System Overview

The backend is organized around:

- A REST-style service layer
- A relational database core
- SQL-driven analytical queries

No production credentials, datasets, or deployment instructions are included.

---

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with:

- Designing normalized relational schemas
- Translating business rules into SQL constraints
- Implementing transaction-safe operations
- Managing time-series financial-style data
- Understanding how application logic interacts with database guarantees

---

## Disclaimer

This repository is provided **for demonstration of engineering concepts only**.

It does not include:

- Assignment specifications
- Test datasets
- Deployment instructions
- Configuration files
- Full reproducibility steps

The code is not intended to be used for academic submission.

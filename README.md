# relational-query-engine-sql
A miniature relational database system implementing core DBMS concepts.

Implemented components include:

- Relational schema design and normalization (3NF / BCNF)
- Multi-relation SQL query evaluation
- Join processing and aggregation
- Transaction schedules and conflict analysis
- Two-phase locking (2PL) simulation
- ACID property analysis
- Index-based access reasoning

This project emphasizes understanding how relational databases
execute and guarantee correctness beneath SQL.
